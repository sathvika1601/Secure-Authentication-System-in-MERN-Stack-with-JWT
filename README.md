
This project is a secure login and signup application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, featuring JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication. It allows users to register and log in, generating a secure token for session management. The app demonstrates full-stack development with secure, token-based authentication and protection of private routes.
